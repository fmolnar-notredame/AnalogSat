To compile the MiniSat library, you can use one of the following:

- On Windows, use the Visual Studio project, wrapped in either the
  local Solution file (MiniSatLib.sln), which compiles only the library,
  or use the main Solution file (../AnalogSat.sln) and compile it along
  with the rest of the AnalogSat package.

- On Linux or Mac, use the provided "build.sh" shell script. The script uses
  the NVIDIA CUDA compiler "nvcc", even though the code does not use CUDA.
  This is done to avoid any incompatibility when linking this library
  with AnalogSat and its Frontend together, the latter requiring nvcc.
