To compile the AnalogSat library, you can use one of the following:

- On Windows, use the Visual Studio project, wrapped in either the
  local Solution file (AnalogSatLib.sln), which compiles only the library,
  or use the main Solution file (../AnalogSat.sln) and compile it along
  with the rest of the AnalogSat package. The library requires the
  NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit to be installed.

- On Linux, use the provided "build.sh" shell script. The script requires
  the NVIDIA CUDA compiler "nvcc". The first lines of the script defines
  the CUDA architectures and compute capabilities that will be used for
  compilation. Make sure your GPU's compute capability is included among
  them.
