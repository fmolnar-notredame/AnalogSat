  MiniSat and AnalogSat libraries as additional projects, which will be
  compiled along with the Frontend. The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit to be installed.

- On Linux, the AnalogSat and MiniSat libraries must be compiled first. 
  See the COMPILE.txt file for instructions in the folders of both libraries
  for instructions. Then, use the provided "build.sh" shell script. 
  The script requires the NVIDIA CUDA compiler "nvcc".
